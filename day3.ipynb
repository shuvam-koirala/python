    "## Widget Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "All the widgets of tkinter have some basic set of styling options which allows us to style the widget according to our need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some basic styling options:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Colors\n",
    "\n",
    "Most widgets allow you to specify the widget and text colors, using the background and foreground options. To specify a color, you can either use a color name, or explicitly specify the red, green, and blue (RGB) color components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Color Names you can use\n",
    "Tkinter includes a color database which maps color names to the corresponding RGB values. This database includes common names like red, green, blue, yellow, and light blue etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "This link leads you to the color chart containing all available colors in tkinter\n",
    "<a>http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Color_Charts_for_TKinter</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to explicitly specify a color, you can use a string with the following format:\n",
    "#RRGGBB\n",
    "\n",
    "RR, GG, BB are hexadecimal representations of the red, green and blue values, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fonts \n",
    "Widgets that allow you to display text in one way or another also allows you to specify which font to use. All widgets provide reasonable default values, and you seldom have to specify the font for simpler elements like labels and buttons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fonts are usually specifed using the font widget option. Tkinter supports a number of different font descriptor types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Font descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "    User-defined font names\n",
    "\n",
    "    System fonts\n",
    "\n",
    "    X font descriptors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Font descriptors \n",
    "Starting with Tk 8.0, Tkinter supports platform independent font descriptors. You can specify a font as tuple containing a family name, a height in points, and optionally a string with one or more styles. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"Times\", 10, \"bold\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"Helvetica\", 10, \"bold italic\")\n",
    "\n",
    "(\"Symbol\", 8)\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the default size and style, you can give the font name as a single string. If the family name doesn’t include spaces, you can also add size and styles to the string itself:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Times 10 bold\"\n",
    "\"Helvetica 10 bold italic\"\n",
    "\"Symbol 8\"\n",
    "Here are some families available on most Windows platforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "Arial (corresponds to Helvetica), Courier New (Courier), Comic Sans MS, Fixedsys, MS Sans Serif, MS Serif, Symbol, System, Times New Roman (Times), and Verdana:\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if the family name contains spaces, you must use the tuple syntax described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The available styles are normal, bold, roman, italic, underline, and overstrike.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Font names \n",
    "In addition, Tk 8.0 allows you to create named fonts and use their names when specifying fonts to the widgets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tkFont module provides a Font class which allows you to create font instances. You can use such an instance everywhere Tkinter accepts a font specifier. You can also use a font instance to get font metrics, including the size occupied by a given string written in that font.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "tkFont.Font(family=\"Times\", size=10, weight=tkFont.BOLD)\n",
    "tkFont.Font(family=\"Helvetica\", size=10, weight=tkFont.BOLD,\n",
    "            slant=tkFont.ITALIC)\n",
    "tkFont.Font(family=\"Symbol\", size=8)\n",
    "If you modify a named font (using the config method), the changes are automatically propagated to all widgets using the font.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Font constructor supports the following style options (note that the constants are defined in the tkFont module):\n",
    "\n",
    "##### family\n",
    "Font family.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### size\n",
    "Font size in points. To give the size in pixels, use a negative value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### weight\n",
    "Font thickness. Use one of NORMAL or BOLD. Default is NORMAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### slant\n",
    "Font slant. Use one of NORMAL or ITALIC. Default is NORMAL.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### underline\n",
    "Font underlining. If 1 (true), the font is underlined. Default is 0 (false).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### overstrike\n",
    "Font strikeout. If 1 (true), a line is drawn over text written with this font. Default is 0 (false).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text Formatting \n",
    "While text labels and buttons usually contain a single line of text, Tkinter also supports multiple lines. To split the text across lines, simply insert newline characters (\\n) where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the lines are centered. You can change this by setting the justify option to LEFT or RIGHT. The default value is CENTER.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the wraplength option to set a maximum width, and let the widget wrap the text over multiple lines all by itself. Tkinter attempts to wrap on whitespace, but if the widget is too narrow, it may break individual words across lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Borders\n",
    "All Tkinter widgets have a border (though it’s not visible by default for some widgets). The border consists of an optional 3D relief, and a focus highlight region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relief\n",
    "The relief settings control how to draw the widget border:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### borderwidth (or bd)\n",
    "This is the width of the border, in pixels. Most widgets have a default borderwidth of one or two pixels. There’s hardly any reason to make the border wider than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### relief\n",
    "This option controls how to draw the 3D border. It can be set to one of SUNKEN, RAISED, GROOVE, RIDGE, and FLAT.\n",
